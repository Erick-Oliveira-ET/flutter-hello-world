# Flutter Hello World
An app that generates random names and has a list of the ones marked as favorites.

It's flutter's first tutorial. It's really nice. The first time I actually followed a docs tutorial. I liked this first contact with flutter. It was less annoying than React Native, at least the beginning of it.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
