# Flutter Hello World
An app that generates random names and has a list of the ones marked as favorites.

It's flutter's first tutorial. It's really nice. The first time I actually followed a docs tutorial. I liked this first contact with flutter. It was less annoying than React Native, at least the beginning of it.
